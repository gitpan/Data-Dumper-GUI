NAME
    Data::Dumper::GUI - just what Data::Dumper needed... a GUI

SYNOPSIS
       use Data::Dumper::GUI;
   
       print Dumper(@variables);

DESCRIPTION
    Data::Dumper::GUI is a little like Data::Dumper, but as well as printing
    out a dump of the variables it is passed, it also shows them in a pretty
    GUI (graphical user interface) with a tree view, allowing you to expand
    and collapse nodes, etc.

    It has special secret sauce support for Moose objects. (And for Moo
    objects too, if you make sure Moose is loaded before dumping them.)
